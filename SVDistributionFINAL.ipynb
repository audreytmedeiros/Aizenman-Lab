    "\n",
    "## What you need to run this code: \n",
    "1. You need a SV.zip file in every synapse folder. This zip file contains ROIs for each SV in that synapse. There can only be one zip file in that folder that ends with SV.zip. Ensure that is your final SV count.\n",
    "2. You need an AZ.txt file. This is explained below:\n",
    "    * Open synapse image in Fiji and open plasma membrane PM.zip file in ROI manager. \n",
    "    * Draw a freehand line along the AZ, using your PM ROIs as boundaries\n",
    "    * Select your AZ line --> File--> Save as...--> XY Coordinates. \n",
    "    * Save in Syn__ folder as Syn__AZ.txt\n",
    "        * This file is a list of some coordinates on your line, NOT all of them. The code will fix that. \n",
    "3. You need a main folder, mine was called Synapse Files. If yours is different, you need to change the code in \"call previous function while running through folders\" cell in Synapse_files = Path('**YOUR FOLDER NAME**/')\n",
    "    * Under my main Synapse Files folder, I have separate folders for each condition. Within those condition folders, are the folders of synapse files corresponding to that condition."
